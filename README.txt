Car Rental System with the user being able to select the following attributes, if available, for rental;
1. The make of the car
2. The model of the car (dependant on #1)
3. The style of the car (Dependant on #1 and #2)

Three classes (CarTemp, CarBooking and Car) are used; CarBooking inherits Car.

After the final selection, total price is calculated dependant on that car's day base rate, tax rate and the number of rental days and presented to the user.
