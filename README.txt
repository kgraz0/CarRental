Car rental system where the user is able to select the Make, Model, Type of the car, and how many days they want to rent it for. The price will be displayed to the user depending on their selection.

Since the classes are nested, you will need to compile Car.java and then run:

java Car$Booking$RentalDetails$Details

Then just follow the instructions on the screen.
